        <h3>Lost With Reason -n- Rhyme</h3>
       	<p>a lost rhyme tried to find reason<br>
        	searched for it through all seasons<br>
		an off-beat track was taken<br>
		it left sense forsaken<br><br>
		a lost reason tried to find rhyme<br>
		searched for it through all of time<br>
		an on-beat track was taken<br>
		it left confidence shaken<br><br>
		reality's legend<br>
		just ice cold facts<br><br>
		imagination's end<br>
		fantasy contracts<br><br>
		motionâ€™s friction inside emotion<br>
		releases frozen notions<br>
		expressions needing time to thaw<br>
		do not pick at them with your jaw<br><br>
		left lost inside reason and rhyme<br>
		i wonder ...<br><br>
		when did living become a crime</p>
